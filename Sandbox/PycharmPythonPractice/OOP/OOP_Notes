Self provides a convenient way to access and modify an object within a method

#Using id() to determine if object is mutable or immutable

# Using dir() to determine which built-in attributes are present
print(dir(MyInstance))

using is to determine if both object is the same.

help('__class__')

class method only works with class data, it doesn't know about any data associated with an instance data

# Difference between is and ==
An is expression evaluates to True if two variables point to the
same (identical) object.
An == expression evaluates to True if the objects referred to by
the variables are equal (have the same contents).

You can think of a Python class as a “data record plus.” It can do everything a
passive data record can do—store a series of data fields in different formats—
but potentially much more.

 An instance of a class is called an object. This means that there is a one-to many
relationship between classes and objects. For each class, you can create
zero or more objects.

an_obj = ClassName(args)
another_obj = ClassName(args)

 A function defined within a class is called a method.

 A reference to the object itself is passed as the first argument to such a method.
By convention, this argument is named self. It should be placed at the beginning
of each method definition.

def method_name(self, other_args):
statements

 However, when you call an instance method, you do not include the self
argument. That is passed automatically.
object.method_name(args)

Classes generally have at least one method: _ _init_ _, which creates instance
variables recognized by every object of the class.

def _ _init_ _(self, other_args):
self.var1 = value
self.var2 = value
self.var3 = value

 Other special methods include _ _str_ _, which produces a string representation
used by the print function. This method must return a string. Still other
special methods are _ _add_ _, _ _eq_ _, and _ _sub_ _.

 You can also create any number of your own method names. Use of a leading
underscore or two (_) is encouraged as a way of signaling that the member
should be regarded as private. However, you should avoid using the combination
of leading and trailing double underscores, as in _ _init_ _, because that convention
is used by special method names.

 All references to an instance variable from within the class definition must be
accessed as self.name.

 Remember to use the dot notation (.) to access instance variables as well as methods.

When one class inherits from another, it automatically gets the methods and
attributes of that parent object—which it may either maintain or override.
A class inheriting from another is said to subclass the other class, which in
turn becomes the superclass or parent class.

The basic syntax for subclassing is
class class_name(base_class):

The way to call another class’s version of a function is to use the dot (.) notation.
class_name.method(self, args)

The difference is that static methods take no additional argument
at all, whereas class methods take an additional argument referring to the
class itself.

Static methods have the following syntax:

@staticmethod
def method_name(args):
statements

The syntax for class methods is similar. The difference is that the extra
argument (which by convention is cls) provides a convenient way to call other
methods of the same class, as cls.method.

@classmethod
def method_name(cls, args):
    statements

Inheritance is realized through subclassing in Python. The following syntax
causes new_class to automatically include all the methods and class variables
of base_class (although the methods may be overridden):
class new_class(base_class):
    definitions

 Remember that _ _init_ _ is a true initialization function. This makes some
aspects of inheritance easier. In particular, the _ _init_ _ function is automatically
inherited but may be overridden.

 A subclass may call any method in the base class by referring to the base class
explicitly and using the dot notation (.).
class Dog(Pet):
def _ _init_ _(self, name, breed, age, toy):
self.toy = toy
Pet._ _init_ _(self, name, breed, age)

 Class variables are defined directly under the class header rather than from within
a method. Class variables are shared by all members of the class and are always
referred to with the syntax class_name.var, rather than object_name.var
or self.var.

Getter Methods
To write a getter method for a property, place the following definition inside
a class:

@property # "Getter" method
def property_name(self):
    statements
    return value

class MyClass:
    def _ _init_ _(self):
        self._a = self._b = self_c = -1

@property # "Getter" for property a
def a(self):
    return self._a

@property # "Getter" for property b
def b(self):
    return abs(self._b)

@property # "Getter" for property c
def c(self):
    return self._c % 2 == 0

To build your own iterable in Python, write a generator function. Instead of
returning a value, the generator uses a yield statement.
yield x

The getter method for a property is called when the user of a class tries to get
the value of the property. A getter has this syntax:

@property
def property_name(self):
    statements
    return value

 The setter method for a property is called when the user of a class tries to set
the property’s value. A setter has this syntax:

@property_name.setter
def(self, new_value):
    statements

In Python, functions have attributes, just as other objects do. You can use the
__fname__ attribute to get the name of the function at the time it was defined.
print(f.__name__)

This sets the new value if one is provided, and then returns the currently set value.

if c: self._color=c
return self._color

If your variables are encapsulated, this means they belong to the object and not to the class.
