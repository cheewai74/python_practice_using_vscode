 __new__() method was created mainly to facilitate the creation of subclasses of immutable types
 (such as int, str, list) and metaclasses.

 __repr__() defines the “official” string representation of the object. Ideally,
  should output a string that is a valid Python statement and can be used to recreate the object.
  It is mainly used for debugging

"""

    The __getitem__() and __setitem__() methods are used to implement the built-in functionality
    of using [index/key] to read and edit elements of a sequence object like a list or
    a mapping object like dict.
